# 1. Tokenizer: An utterance into smaller chunks of text, known as tokens.
# 2. Featurizer: Converting user messages into numerical vectors for machine learning models.
# 3. Intent classifer: Classifying the user's intent by analyzing the language they use
# 4. Entity extractor: Identify and extract entity information

  # Components make up your NLU pipeline and work sequentially to process user input into structured output
